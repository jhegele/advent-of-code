**NOT YET COMPLETE**

## Notes

So far, this has been my least favorite problem. While I appreciate the challenge the problem presents, it's just a pain to deal with all the mappings (which, to be fair, is partly the point). I ultimately looked for advice on how to deal with Part 2 so I know how to go about it. Not sure if I'll come back and finish it up, though.

## Part 1

Parsing the data to get the mappings is the biggest pain here. Once you have that you just run the seed through all of the mappings to get the result which is pretty straightforward.

My implementation is honestly pretty ugly and there's probably lots of ways to do this better but, eh, it got the job done I suppose.

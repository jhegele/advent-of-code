# AoC Typescript

For some (maybe all?) puzzles, I'll also try to solve in Typescript. I actually write a lot more Typescript than Python these days so you'd think I'd solve in Typescript and replicate in Python. But I like writing Python and it's good to get back into a bit, even if it's for one month of the year.

I'm also testing out Bun which seems to be the "hot new thing" in the Javascript/Typescript world. This seemed like a good, low stakes environment to test out something that's relatively new so, there's that.
